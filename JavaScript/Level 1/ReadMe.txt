What is JavaScript ?
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that allows you to make web pages
 interactive and dynamic. 
 Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the core technologies of web development.
	• HTML → Builds the structure of a webpage (headings, paragraphs, buttons).
	• CSS → Adds style and design (colors, fonts, layouts).
	• JavaScript → Adds behavior and interactivity (clicks, animations, live updates).
Who Created JavaScript?
	• Originally named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally renamed to JavaScript.
	• Amazingly, the first version was developed in just 10 days.
	• Today, JavaScript is maintained by ECMA International under the standard ECMAScript (ES).
Latest versions (ES6 and beyond) introduced features like let, const, arrow functions, promises, and classes — making JavaScript more powerful and modern.
Why Use JavaScript?
JavaScript is used everywhere — from simple web pages to large-scale applications.
Here’s what you can do with it:
	1. Interactive Web Pages – Respond to user actions like clicks, hover, or form submissions.
	2. DOM Manipulation – Dynamically change HTML content or CSS styles.
	3. Web Applications – Build apps like Gmail, Facebook, or e-commerce websites.
	4. Server-Side Development – Use Node.js for backend tasks like APIs and databases.
	5. Games and Animations – Create browser games and animations.
Event Handling – React to keyboard, mouse, or page events.
